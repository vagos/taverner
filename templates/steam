# To get the APPID of your Steam games you can do the following: 
# Go to your SteamLibrary/steamapps folder. There, you will find various
# appmanifest_*.acf files. The number part of the filename is your app's appid.
# If you open the file, you will see a json-like formatted file. Look at the
# "name" part. That's your app's human-readable name.

# For example, the APPID of 'Left 4 Dead 2' is 550.
